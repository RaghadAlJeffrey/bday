            <h2>Sahar,</h2>
            <p>On all seriousness, I have been working for a while on this that I do not even have the words to finish this project with lmao. <br>
             Where do I even start? Sahar, you are magnificent. I never in my life imagined I would
             meet someone like you. You make me laugh with your clumsy acts. 
             I admire that you always wear your heart on your sleeves no matter what.
             Your kindness is something I never witnessed before. You are a ball of chaos, unpredictably evil but equally an angel.
             You are like Satan, can be an angel whenever but also evil when needed.
             You make this shitty world a better place. If you ever feel like you are doubting yourself I will be there to believe in you until you regain your strength. 
             You make everything fun and wholesome sometimes even chaotic, but that's your charm. 
             It's like you have this magical ability to turn the most mundane moments into incredible memories.
              Your spontaneity keeps me on my toes, and I would not trade you for the world. (maybe for a million dollars but only so our broke asses can finally be rich then I will get you back).
             
               You are unbelievably the perfect blend of all the best qualities a person could have.
              Thank you for showing me what true friendships is like.
                I hope you know how much you mean to me.
                I love you, <Br>
                    -Yours truly the best T-Rex, <br>
