            <h2>Sahar,</h2>
            <p>I have been working for a while on this that I do not even have the words to finish this project with lmao. <br>
             You know I was going to get you a cool gift but then I remembered there is nothing cooler than me. Seriously though,
             where do I even start? Sahar, you are extraordinary. Unique in the most magnificent way.
             Meeting you started off conflicting but little did I know you would be one of the best people I have ever encountered.
            Your sense of humor is unholy, a blackhole if you will. But I live for it. You make me laugh with your unpredictably.<br>

             One of the many qualities I admire about you is that you always wear your heart on your sleeves. I could name all of your amazing qualities
             but this will be one hell of a long ass website.
             <br>

             I never knew I would find a friend for life in you. You are literally a ball of chaos, every moment with you is a surprise.
             It's like you have this ability to turn the most mundane moments into absolutely unhinged memories that I cherish.
             I would not trade you for the world. (maybe for a million dollars but only so our broke asses can finally be rich then I will get you back).
             <br>
               Never forget how awesome you are. Walk in your power cause mf you are strong.
              Thank you, Sahar, for showing me what true friendships is like.

                I hope you know how much you mean to me.
                Love you asswipe<Br>
                    -Yours truly the GOATED T-Rex, <br>
