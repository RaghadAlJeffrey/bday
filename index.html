            <h2>Sahar,</h2>
            <p>On all seriousness, I have been working for a while on this that I do not even have the words to finish this project with lmao. <br>
             Where do I even start with someone as brilliant as you? Sahar, you have this incredible knack for making me laugh with the goofiest little acts. 
             Or even your unpredictable comments that come out of nowhere and baffle me. 
             Honestly, whether you believe it or not, you make this world a better place. When you feel like you are doubting yourself I will be there to believe in you until you regain your strength. 
             You make everything fun and wholesome sometimes even chaotic, but that's your charm. 
             It's like you have this magical ability to turn the most mundane moments into unforgettable memories.
              Your spontaneity keeps me on my toes, and I would not trade you for the world. (maybe for a million dollars but only so our broke asses would finally be rich).
              But here's the thing that truly makes you extraordinary; despite all your chaotic gremlin energy, you have the kindest heart.
               It's like you're the perfect blend of all the best qualities a person could have. Your thoughtfulness and compassion never cease to amaze me.
               You have proved me wrong about my cynicsm. While I still do have trust issues, you have shown me what a true friend is like. You have raised my standards of friends.
               And while you spontaneously hate people as a fellow misanthrope, I know deep down you are kind.
                You're beautiful inside and out, wear your heart on your sleeve and I feel incredibly lucky to call you my best friend. 
                Sometimes I wonder how I got so fortunate to have someone as magnificent as you in my life. 
                You make everything better just by being around. Whether we're doing something exciting or just lounging around, I'm always grateful for your company. 
                I hope you know how much you mean to me. 
                Thank you for being the amazing person you are, and for making every day a little brighter just by being in it. I can't wait for all the adventures and laughter we have ahead of us.
                I love you you asswipe. <Br>
                    -Yours truly the best T-Rex, <br>
